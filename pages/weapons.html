                <h2>
                    Frenzy has a lot of weapons to offer. Since the weapons page in-game shouldn't be too overwhelming,
                    some less important stats and additional info isn't shown. This is why this page exists. Since
                    there's more room to work with, players can more easily view all of the info they want on whatever
                    weapon they want. Additionally, you can compare wepaons faster here, so that you can more quickly
                    find out what weapons work best with what characters.

                <h2>Primary Weapons: Assault Rifles</h2>
                <h3>
                    Assault rifles are the default weapon class. They fire hard, the fire fast, and they do it
                    automatically. Every champion excluding legends has access to assault rifles. They are a reliable
                    option that you really can't go wrong with.

                <h2>Primary Weapons: Burst Rifles</h2>
                <h3>
                    Burst rifles are similar to assault rifles, but they only shoot a few bullets at a time,
                    go on cooldown and then shoot again a second or so later. They are basically a direct
                    counterpart to the assault rifle. You can play them like an assault rifle or you can play them the
                    way that some people find annoying (that I love to do).
                </h3>

            <div class="divider">
                <h2>Primary Weapons: DMRs</h2>
                <h3>
                    DMRs are basically a hybrid of assault rifles and sniper rifles: They average out all of the stats
                    between them in order to create a monster that you can play like either one. With fast, single-fire
                    shots that deal heavy damage, you can use a DMR in both long range and medium range combat
                    effectively. You can also peek around a corner, fire one shot and repeat if you're that kind of guy.
                </h3>

            <div class="divider">
                <h2>Primary Weapons: Snipers</h2>
                <h3>
                    Snipers are for those who want the most powerful of all weapons. With most of them capable of
                    killing enemies in one shot, you do not want to mess with a trained sniper. However, this comes with
                    a significan't drawback: most high-end snipers need to be placed on the ground to be used, and
                    you're very vulnerable whilst doing so. So you better have a good position, otherwise you're toast.
                    Of course, you can still move about with the less powerful snipers, but you'll only be able to
                    oneshot your opponents when shooting them in the head.
